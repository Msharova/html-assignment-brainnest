            <strong>Geralt of Rivia</strong> (Polish: Geralt z Rivii) is a fictional character
            and the protagonist of The Witcher Saga of short stories and novels by Polish author
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski" target="_blank">Andrzej 
            Sapkowski</a>. He is a magically enhanced monster-hunter known as a "witcher", who
            possesses supernatural abilities due to his mutations. He was described by PÃ©ter Apor
            as a character embodying "the neo-liberal anti-politics" spirit of Polish popular 
            culture of the 1990s, following his debut in the books.
