            <strong>The Witcher</strong> (Polish: Wied≈∫min) is a 2007 action role-playing game
            developed by <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a> 
            for Microsoft Windows and CD Projekt on OS X. It was based on the fantasy novel series 
            The Witcher by Polish author 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski" target="_blank">Andrzej Sapkowski</a>.
            The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga. It was released in 2007 to
            positive reviews from critics and received an aggregate score of 81/100 on Metacritic. In 2009,
            a console version, The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf, was scheduled for release using an 
            entirely new engine and combat system. This was suspended as a result of payment problems with
            console developers Widescreen Games. The first game has, to date, two sequels, namely 
            <a href="./witcher2.html">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a> in 2011 and 
            <a href="./witcher3.html">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> in 2015.
