            <strong>Triss Merigold of Maribor</strong> was a legendary
            Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth
            of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously
            thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill,
            she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of
            King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz,
            as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was
            involved in politics for most of her life.
