            <strong>Vesemir</strong> is a supporting protagonist in the Witcher
            franchise. He is an elderly, highly experienced Witcher and the mentor
            and father figure of <a href="./geralt.html">Geralt of Rivia</a>. Like
            many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set
            out on the path when spring arrived. He is one of only a few surviving
            witchers left in the 13th century, along with Geralt, Lambert and Eskel.
            Like Geralt, he trained under the School of the Wolf.
