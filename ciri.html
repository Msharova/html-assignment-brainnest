            <strong>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon</strong>, known as Ciri,
            the Lady of Time and Space and princess of Cintra, is one of
            the main characters of the Witcher saga, around whom much of 
            the plot is centered. She is the lion cub of Cintra, daughter
            of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of Erlenwald) 
            and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt's 
            destiny and adopted daughter. Ciri is a descendant of Lara
            Dorren and has the Elder blood which gives her access to powers
            that allow her to cross space and time.
