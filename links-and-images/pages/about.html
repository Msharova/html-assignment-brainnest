       <strong>Wag the Dog</strong> is a 1997 American political satire black comedy film 
        produced and directed by Barry Levinson and starring Dustin Hoffman 
        and Robert De Niro. The film centers on a spin doctor and a Hollywood 
        producer who fabricate a war in Albania to distract voters from a 
        presidential sex scandal. The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David 
        Mamet was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart's 1993 novel, American Hero.
