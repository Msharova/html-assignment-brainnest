            Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, commonly known
            as <strong>Dandelion</strong> (Polish: Jaskier) is a poet, 
            minstrel, bard, and Geralt's best friend. The Polish word jaskier
            actually refers to the Buttercup flower (Ranunculus). Some of his 
            more famous ballads were about the relationship between 
            <a  href="./geralt.html">Geralt</a> and <a href="./yennefer.html">Yennefer</a>.
